For my systems dynamics class, I chose to model an autonomous sailboat for our final project. The final report is attached below.

Task/Role: Define the sailboat model through term definition and a FBD. Develop a PD controller block diagram to define a control law for the rudder angle to enable line following via changing the heading of the boat.
